I'm curious about your name though. 
How should I call you?

~rJina:
Nice to meet you ~playerName,
I am Jina by the way. 
Why don't we go outside for a bit? 
I want to show you something.

~rJina:
Can you see those walking logs, ~playerName? 
You must have been surprised when you saw them the first time...
We don't know much about them yet, 
except that they are hostile.

~rJina:
Honestly there's so much we don't know about them. 
They appeared one morning after an extreme thunderstorm. 
It was a few months ago, but we still have no clue about what happened that night.

~rJina:

But that's why we're so excited about your arrival! 
We are all sure that you're the one destined to save our world from suffering, as our holy religious book predicts it.

That's fine.
I'll give you my old sword to practice and you'll be ready to fight in no time.
Also, people have high hopes in you ~playerName. 
We all trust you. 
Now lets go inside again and IÂ´ll show you how to fight!
